Looking up the right syntax for your code, seeking help from experienced programmers, securing a detailed tutorial to configure a new 
unfamiliar software. All tasks that I thought were as easy as posting "How to download X" to yahoo answers and waiting for a reply. It 
turns out that within the world of software developers or just hackers in general, this type of self-fulfiling one and done kind of 
request for help just does not cut it, and honestly, it's for a good reason. From what I've gathered, and this, of course, isn't true in 
every single case, is that hacker culture maintains a sort of gift economy. Whether out of the goodness of their hearts or because 
enforcing a payment per download system is extremely difficult, developers often subscribe to a system where the products that they 
generage will be available to any interested party as well as easily modifiable for anyone who can find areas for improvement. This 
creates a sort of positive feedback loop where products are released for free which are then improved or used to build other bigger and 
better products which are then used to create even better products and so on and so forth. As you can see, this system can lead to 
exciting results, which is why the assistance process should be no different.
