I LOVE Javascript. I'm not very experienced in it or even that good, really, but it is an amazing language for programming. I'm a computer engineer taking a computer science class so I've been practicing in Python, C++, and C so far. Except for an introductory 126 coding problems that I rushed through in a short amount of time, the Javascript that I'm writing now is the first Javascript code I've ever written. This does not diminish my interest in the slightest. 

Even though I was stuck on a lot of the coding problems, even though I ended up completely failing WOD 1, I can't help but be attracted to the convenience and flexibility of Javascript. This might be all down to personal preference, but I feel like Javascript posseses a casual feel that C just doesn't and yet, Javascript feels like it's capable of more, especially when it comes to app or website design. Again, this is all just speculation, but I really am looking forward to pursuing Javascript and seeing what it really is capable of.

As for the athletic software engineering, I love it. I failed the first one pretty badly, not going to lie, but I've learned my mistakes, completed some more Javascript practice problems, and am ready to try again. It's because I really feel alive with a limited amount of time and a sense of competition in the air. I feel like it brings out my best work and really sharpens my ability to think on my feet. I'm looking forward to more WODs which will either be followed with winning or more mistakes to learn from.
