First off, I just want to say that after only a couple assignments where I used this platform with these tools, I don’t feel like I can put together to accurate of an impression. That being said, I still feel like there are definite things I can say I like and things I dislike about my new programming environment. 

Starting with the things I don’t like, ESLint. Like I said, I’ve just started using it and my feelings towards it will probably change down the line, but given that it’s showing to be something I have trouble with, I can’t help but have at least a little negative feeling towards it. Most of which stems from despite my code being correct and compiling correctly, ESLint was still not happy with the problematic patterns that it had detected in my program. I suppose it’s my stubborn pride or my joy in seeing our own unique styles develop that compels me to resist ESLint’s instruction and continue on with my own code, but I am open to seeing this tool as useful one day. When I tackle more large scale projects, a part of me feels like I will be besides myself with joy to have a program that can detect problems before they happen. So even if ESLint and I are currently at odds, I do have hope that upon exploring the full range of it’s potential, it will become something that enhances me rather than hinder me. 

As for the total coding game changers, IntelliJ coupled with the GitHub portfolio has been nothing short of illuminating. It’s almost as if I’m being allowed to see the world in color for the first time. Dramatic, I know, but I can’t help, but get excited at the full range of capabilities and level of reach that these platforms offer me. This may sound adorable to some senior level programmers, but the fact that I can access and manipulate the browser from my compiler sets my teeth on edge. If this is what’s possible with only a couple days of practicing IntelliJ, I can’t wait to see what will be within my means by the end of this semester.
