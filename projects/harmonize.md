With the assistance of amazing technologies like the Amazon Alexa and the AWS platform, I set about designing an Amazon skill that could automate devices within the home. The idea would be that a basic command would be given to the Amazon Alexa to perform, but instead of merely returning a fact or playing a song, the Harmonize skill would give the Alexa the ability to distribute commands to several devices around the house.
